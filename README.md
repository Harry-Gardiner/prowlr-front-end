## Brief
DevelopMe_ wk, 12 task. 

Think up an idea for an app/website that would be achievable in a week. Choose one idea to pursue.

## General info
Front end developers: 
- Harry 
- Vicky (hosted both fron and back repos)
Back end developers:
- Tom
- Ben
See back end repo here https://github.com/Harry-Gardiner/prowlr-back-end	

As a group we collectively decidided to build a fun app that would test both our front and back end skills. The app is loosely inspired by tinder and aims at providing animals with a chance to find love. Currently the functionaluty of the app is like/dislike animal profiles with a results table, but we had much bigger plans!

**Post completion questions:**

What was the most enjoyable part?
- Seeing the app come to life from an idea at the start of the week
- Team aspect
- Working on a project of our choosing rather than something already chosen for us

What was the least enjoyable part?
- Git merge conflicts
- Back end deployment
- CSS bugs

If you had more time, what features would you add?
- Have the animals able to match 
- Search by tags
- Have a create your own profile
- App refresh would keep you in the same place instead of starting it from the beginning

If you were to start from scratch, what would you do differently?
- Be able to spend more time on the css root file
- Responsiveness
- Made sure that we had all images in the same format and size to keep the profile consistent 
- Make sure weâ€™re working in specific branches
